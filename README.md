# SpaceGUI

SpaceGUI is a project I came up with as a challenge to myself. In doing so, I gave myself just a few hours to create a simple application to learn the basics of GUI programming in Python.

## Features

- Request the ten upcoming orbital and suborbital launches from [The Space Devs API](https://thespacedevs.com)
- Write the information to a local JSON file to reduce API calls
- Display information in a GUI, with a map that shows the general location of the launch site and information about the mission

## Technology
To make SpaceGUI work, some additional libraries were used:

- [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) - Able to display a map at indicated location.
- [PyQT](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/introduction.html) - Package that makes creating GUI applications easier.
